Exercise 1.7: Finalizing Your Python Program
Learning Goals

●	Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper
●	Build your final command-line Recipe application


Reflection Questions

1.	What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one?

2.	By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve?

3.	Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question.
 
4.	You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far: 
a.	What went well during this Achievement? 
b.	What’s something you’re proud of? 
c.	What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement? 
d.	Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?
e.	What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?

Well done—you’ve now completed the Learning Journal for Achievement 1. As you’ll have seen, a little metacognition can go a long way!
