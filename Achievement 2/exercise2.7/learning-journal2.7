Exercise 2.7: Data Analysis and Visualization in Django

Learning Goals

●	Work on elements of two-way communication like creating forms and buttons
●	Implement search and visualization (reports/charts) features
●	Use QuerySet API, DataFrames (with pandas), and plotting libraries (with matplotlib)

Reflection Questions

1.	Consider your favorite website/application (you can also take CareerFoundry). Think about the various data that 
    your favorite website/application collects. Write down how analyzing the collected data could help the 
    website/application. 



2.	Read the Django official documentation on QuerySet API. Note down the different ways in which you can evaluate 
    a QuerySet.



3.	In the Exercise, you converted your QuerySet to DataFrame. Now do some research on the advantages and 
    disadvantages of QuerySet and DataFrame, and explain the ways in which DataFrame is better for data processing.
